# SlowJuice

## Work Enviorment Setup

To run and edit the project you need to download and install the Godot editor. Since the project uses c# you have to download the **mono** version. We also need to make sure the **monosdk** is installed. *If you are working on windows, download the non gtk version of mono.*
- [Godot Download](https://godotengine.org/download)
- [MonoSDK Download](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)

When you have opened Godot you will be shown a empty project select window. To add SlowJuice you must press the **Scan** button on the right side of the screen. This should open up a folder select window, navigate to where you cloned the git repo and select the SlowJuice folder.(The repo itself) Now everything should be setup and running.

You can use any c# IDE you want as long as it opens .csproj files. To enable your IDE of choice as default, open the SlowJuice project go to Editor -> Editor Settings -> Mono -> Editor -> External Editor and change the default.
